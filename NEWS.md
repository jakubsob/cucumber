# cucumber 1.0.3

- Fixed float detection with multiple leading numbers, e.g. `11.1`, `+11.1`, `-11.1`.

# cucumber 1.0.2

- Fixed CRAN debian checks.

# cucumber 1.0.1

- ✨ Changed how `{string}` parameter is matched. It now matches on text in quotes. A step `Given I have a {string}` will match on `Given I have a "foo bar"`. This change brings the parser closer to how the original [cucumber expressions](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-expressions) work.
- ✨ Added a `{word}` parameter that matches on a single word. A step like `Given I have a {word}` will match on `Given I have a foo`.
- 🐛 Fix handling of repeated parameters in the same step. Now if there are steps `Given I have a {string} and a {string}` and `Given I have a {string}` it will match on `Given I have a "foo" and a "bar"` instead of throwing an error that multiple step definitions have been found.
- 📝 Improved documentation of parameters in `define_parameter_type` function docs.
- 📝 Added an example with snapshot test.
